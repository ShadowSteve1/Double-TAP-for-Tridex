# Voron Double-Tap
 A version of Voron-Tap for IDEX machines (Tridex)

Double-Tap is a nozzle-based z-probe for Tridex printer design. 
Both toolheads can move up to trigger an optical switch however due to curent klipper limitations only the left toolhead will be used. 


please see the original Voron-Tap Repo [Here](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap)

you only need to download the 2 parts in this repo to get to Double-Tap which replace a part on the original tap ([a]Tap_Center_r4)

[a]T0_Center_r4.stl (the left toolhead) and [a]T1_Center_r4.stl (the right toolhead)

All other assemblies and parts are as the original version of tap so please follow the voron tap manual for full instructions.
